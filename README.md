# Netflix-data-analysis-project

📊 Netflix Data Analysis Project

This project is a comprehensive Data Science case study focused on analyzing Netflix's dataset. The primary aim is to extract meaningful insights, visualize key trends, and build a predictive model using machine learning techniques.

✅ Project Highlights

🔍 Data Cleaning:
The dataset was thoroughly cleaned by handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing inconsistencies to ensure reliable analysis.

📈 Data Visualization:
We explored various trends and patterns using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. This includes:

Content distribution over the years

Genre popularity

Country-wise content analysis

Duration and type analysis


❓ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
We formulated and answered multiple insightful questions, such as:

Which year had the highest number of releases?

What type of content is most common on Netflix?

Which countries contribute most to Netflix content?


🤖 Machine Learning – Linear Regression:
A Linear Regression model was implemented to predict the number of content releases based on historical trends.
We evaluated the model using:

R² Score (R-squared): Measures how well the regression line fits the actual data.

Adjusted R² Score: Provides a more accurate measure by adjusting for the number of predictors in the model.
